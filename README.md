Genetic Algorithm-based solution to the Student Project Allocation Problem.

The fitness of a solution is defined as the percentage of students whom have been matched with a project in one of their top 3 preferences.

This project does not return solutions of sufficient fitness for practical use.

The program in which projects are allocated to students based on the average grade of the student, prioritising students with higher grades, returns a significantly higher fitness solution.
